## FDF 
Fil de Fer / Wireframe

"The representation in 3D of a landscape is a critical aspect of modern mapping. For example, in these times of spatial exploration, to have a 3D representation of Mars is a prerequisite condition to its conquest.
As another example, comparing various 3D representations of an area of high tectonic activity will allow you to better understand these phenomena and their evolution, and as a result, be better prepared.
Itâ€™s your turn today to modelize some 3D magnificent landscapes, imaginary or not."

## Objectives:

Use the school graphical library: MiniLibX. \
This library was developed internally and includes basic necessary tools to open a window, create images and deal with keyboard and mouse events. \
This is the opportunity to get familiar with MiniLibX, to discover the basics of graphics programming, especially how to place points in space, join them and, most important, how to see the scene from a specific viewpoint. 

Currently WIP.

## Use

Download minilibx Library and move it to the fdf folder check the path and name in the makefile to use it acordingly. \
Now run make and and the library must compile with the project. \
My libft , ft_printf and get_next_line are all in one library already merged in this project so if you want to use yours you need to modify the MAKEFILE. \
LINUX VERSION USED!! I built this hardcoding endian value of to zero if your system uses the other change it in init.c under srcs. \
As long as minilibx folder is called "minilibx" everything should compile.
