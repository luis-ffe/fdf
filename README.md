## FDF: Fil de Fer / Wireframe

The 3D representation of landscapes plays a crucial role in modern mapping techniques. For instance, a detailed 3D model of Mars is essential for future exploration and potential conquest of the planet. Similarly, comparing various 3D representations of regions with significant tectonic activity can enhance our understanding of geological phenomena and their evolution, ultimately leading to better preparedness for such events. 

In this project, you will have the opportunity to create stunning 3D landscapes, whether real or imaginary.

## Objectives

Utilize the **MiniLibX** graphical library, which was developed internally, to access essential tools for opening windows, creating images, and handling keyboard and mouse events. This project serves as an excellent introduction to MiniLibX and graphics programming, focusing on key concepts such as placing points in space, connecting them, and visualizing the scene from a specific viewpoint.

## Usage Instructions

1. Download the MiniLibX library and move it into the FDF project folder. Ensure that the path and name in the Makefile are correctly configured.
2. Run `make` to compile the project along with the library.
3. The `libft`, `ft_printf`, and `get_next_line` libraries are already merged into this project. If you wish to use your own versions, you will need to modify the Makefile accordingly.
4. This project has been developed and tested on a Linux environment. The endian value has been hardcoded to zero; if your system uses a different configuration, please update it in `init.c` under the `srcs` directory.
5. As long as the MiniLibX folder is named "minilibx," everything should compile successfully.
